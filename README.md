Basic operations are very, very simple.
1) Open "Input folder";
2) Open "Output folder";
3) Select how to make folders, like "YYYY","YYYY_MM" "YYYY_MM_DD".
4) Press "Rename" button.

Also you can just rename images, without output folder.
Or delete original images.

Input images are at left table.
Output images are at right table.
If there is a failed image - it adds img to bottom table.
